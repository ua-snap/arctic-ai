# Anchorage (Dgheyaytnu)
General Information: In Anchorage (Dgheyaytnu), The average (mean) elevation near this point is 69ft above sea level. The minimum elevation is 30ft and the maximum elevation is 121ft, which should be kept in mind when interpreting these results.
## Projected Conditions for Anchorage (Dgheyaytnu)
Projected Conditions for Anchorage (Dgheyaytnu): The sections below show output from different scientific simulations of possible future conditions for temperature, precipitation, hydrology, permafrost, flammability, and vegetation change. These simulations use different Global Climate Models (GCMs)—climate models—such as the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Climate System Model 4.0 (NCAR CCSM4).

These climate models use Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) to compare different future greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. Compared to current emissions RCP 4.5 is a scenario representing a reduction in global emissions, while RCP 8.5 represents a scenario similar to, or possibly higher than, current global emissions trajectories. RCP 6.0 is between these two trajectories. Read more about climate models and RCPs.

Some of the data has been averaged by season. Winter is December, January and February, Spring is March, April and May, Summer is June, July and August, Fall is September, October and November.
