# Nome (Sitŋasuaq)
The average (mean) elevation near this point is 39ft above sea level. The minimum elevation is 10ft and the maximum elevation is 154ft, which should be kept in mind when interpreting these results.

## Projected Conditions for Nome (Sitŋasuaq)
The sections below show output from different scientific simulations of possible future conditions for temperature, precipitation, hydrology, permafrost, flammability, and vegetation change. These simulations use different Global Climate Models (GCMs)—climate models—such as the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Climate System Model 4.0 (NCAR CCSM4).

These climate models use Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) to compare different future greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. Compared to current emissions RCP 4.5 is a scenario representing a reduction in global emissions, while RCP 8.5 represents a scenario similar to, or possibly higher than, current global emissions trajectories. RCP 6.0 is between these two trajectories. Read more about climate models and RCPs.

Some of the data has been averaged by season. Winter is December, January and February, Spring is March, April and May, Summer is June, July and August, Fall is September, October and November.

### Temperature
In Nome (Sitŋasuaq), average annual temperatures may increase by about 14°F by the end of the century. Winter temperatures are projected to increase the most (+23°F). Spring and fall may transition from below freezing to above freezing in the future. 
### Precipitation
Models have higher uncertainty with regard to precipitation, but fall is likely to have more precipitation (+33%).
### Permafrost
Models indicate that permafrost degradation may occur at a rate of 1.8 inches per year.
### Flammability
Models indicate that permafrost degradation may occur at a rate of 1.8 inches per year. In the past, this area had very low flammability. Future flammability may be about the same.
### Spruce Beetles
No data.
