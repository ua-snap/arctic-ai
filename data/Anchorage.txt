A changing climate is altering Northern landscapes.

Projected Conditions for Anchorage (Dgheyaytnu)
In Anchorage (Dgheyaytnu),
average annual temperatures
may increase by about 13°F by the end of the century.

Winter temperatures are projected to increase the most (+16°F).

Models have higher uncertainty with regard to precipitation,
but spring is likely to have more precipitation (+48%).

In the past, this area had very low flammability. By the mid–century, flammability may increase to low. By the late–century, flammability may increase to moderate compared with historical flammability.

Based on climate and fire-driven shifts, vegetation in this area may be notably different by the end of the century.

Summary across all models and scenarios. See tables and sections below for more detailed information and definitions.

Introduction
The tables and charts below are specific to the gridded data extracted from the location of Anchorage (Dgheyaytnu), indicated by a marker on the map above. The shaded region on the map is the nearest watershed (hydrological unit, level 12) and is only used to summarize wildfire data around this place.

The average (mean) elevation near this point is 69ft above sea level. The minimum elevation is 30ft and the maximum elevation is 121ft, which should be kept in mind when interpreting these results.

The sections below show output from different scientific simulations of possible future conditions for temperature, precipitation, hydrology, permafrost, flammability, and vegetation change. These simulations use different Global Climate Models (GCMs)—climate models—such as the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Climate System Model 4.0 (NCAR CCSM4).

These climate models use Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) to compare different future greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. Compared to current emissions RCP 4.5 is a scenario representing a reduction in global emissions, while RCP 8.5 represents a scenario similar to, or possibly higher than, current global emissions trajectories. RCP 6.0 is between these two trajectories. Read more about climate models and RCPs.

Some of the data has been averaged by season.

Winter is December, January and February,
Spring is March, April and May,
Summer is June, July and August,
Fall is September, October and November.

Temperature
This section shows projections for average (mean) temperature, compared with a historical range (1950–2009, CRU TS 4.0). Results are averaged by season (three month averages) for two specific climate models (MRI CGCM3 and NCAR CCSM4) as well as average of five models which perform well in Alaska and the Arctic.

Hydrology
This section provides access to historical and projected modeled decadal summaries of hydrologic data for Alaska at a resolution of 12km. These data were derived by applying the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model to downscaled CMIP5 historical and projected climate data, using RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 emissions scenarios.

The tables below show the minimum, mean and maximum values for the annual means across 3 models: CanESM2, GFDL ESM2M, and NCAR CCSM4 and 2 scenarios: RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 for each of the given eras.

As permafrost thaws, the ground depth to the top of the permafrost layer increases. The following chart shows how this depth is projected to change over time.

Wildfire: Flammability and Vegetation
The following maps and charts show the historical and projected flammability and vegetation change for this location, computed using the ALFRESCO model.

Flammability is defined as the percentage of times the pixel at this location has burned in model simulations. All data shown, including historical time periods, are model ouputs.

Data shown in the charts below are the average for the watershed (HUC level 12 ID 190204010808) which contains the pixel location for Anchorage (Dgheyaytnu).

Water, urbanized areas, and mountainous regions are not modeled in the ALFRESCO models. Pixels which are not modeled are shown as white.

See information about the dataset shown here.

This table is a legend for the maps above, and explains different categories of modeled fire activity shown on the chart below. These categories are also used in the short blurb in the introduction to this report.

Flammability	Interpretation
 Not modeled or no data	-	This pixel was not modeled or is not included in the dataset
 Very Low	<0.2%	Fire is absent or very rare
 Low	≥0.2%, <0.5%	Fire is rare, and unlikely to be the primary driver of vegetation patterns on this landscape
 Moderate	≥0.5%, <1%	Fire is frequent enough to partially define the vegetation patterns on this landscape
 High	≥1%, <2%	Fire is more frequent and more dominant in determining vegetation patterns on this landscape
 Very High	≥2%	Fire is highly frequent and dominates the vegetation patterns on this landscape
Hovering over the future eras shown on the chart shows the difference between 1980–2009 and the future era.


Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in predicting vegetation transitions driven by climate and wildfire or by climate alone, the maps below should not be interpreted as vegetation predictions at specific locations, but rather as an indicator of likely general trends in ecological suitability for particular vegetation type over time. Each map–pixel shows the most commonly predicted vegetation type (modal value) based on 200 model runs per year across all years in the map’s date range. Some ecological regions in the far north are projected to undergo marked changes, and others little or no change.
