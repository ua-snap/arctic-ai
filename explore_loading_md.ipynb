These simulations use different Global Climate Models (GCMs)—climate models—such as the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Climate System Model 4.0 (NCAR CCSM4).  \\nThese climate models use Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) to compare different future greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. Compared to current emissions RCP 4.5 is a scenario representing a reduction in global emissions, while RCP 8.5 represents a scenario similar to, or possibly higher than, current global emissions trajectories. RCP 6.0 is between these two trajectories. Read more about climate models and RCPs.  \\nSome of the data has been averaged by season.
