# Juneau (Dzánti K'ihéeni)
The average (mean) elevation near this point is 89ft above sea level. The minimum elevation is 0ft and the maximum elevation is 459ft, which should be kept in mind when interpreting these results.
## Projected Conditions for Juneau (Dzánti K'ihéeni)
The sections below show output from different scientific simulations of possible future conditions for temperature, precipitation, hydrology, permafrost, flammability, and vegetation change. These simulations use different Global Climate Models (GCMs)—climate models—such as the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Climate System Model 4.0 (NCAR CCSM4).

These climate models use Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) to compare different future greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. Compared to current emissions RCP 4.5 is a scenario representing a reduction in global emissions, while RCP 8.5 represents a scenario similar to, or possibly higher than, current global emissions trajectories. RCP 6.0 is between these two trajectories. Read more about climate models and RCPs.

Some of the data has been averaged by season. Winter is December, January and February, Spring is March, April and May, Summer is June, July and August, Fall is September, October and November.

### Temperature
In Juneau (Dzánti K'ihéeni), average annual temperatures may increase by about 11°F by the end of the century. Summer temperatures are projected to increase the most (+13°F). Winter may transition from below freezing to above freezing in the future.
### Precipitation
Models have higher uncertainty with regard to precipitation, but fall is likely to have more precipitation (+28%).
### Permafrost
No data.
### Flammability
In the past, this area had very low flammability. Future flammability may be about the same.
### Spruce Beetles
Historically, climate conditions were minimally protective against spruce beetle outbreaks. Under normal snow conditions, climate conditions in the future may provide less protection by mid-century and about the same protection by late this century.
